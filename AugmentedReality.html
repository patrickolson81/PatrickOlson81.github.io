                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>Develop an augmented reality game within a limited timeframe, incorporating regular playing cards into the gameplay.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Action</h2>
                <p>We decided to create a two-player augmented reality game where playing cards played a pivotal role.  In my role, I took the initiative to singlehandedly write the necessary code to implement Vuforia's object recognition technology. This code allowed us to scan cards in four positions to dynamically generate game levels. One player could use these scanned cards to strategically spawn traps, while the other player's goal was to use cards to navigate the challenges and progress through the game level.                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Result</h2>
                <p>The result of our efforts was a fully functional and engaging augmented reality game. Players could use ordinary playing cards to interact with the game, creating unique levels with each card scan. This innovative approach added a unique twist to the gaming experience, making it both enjoyable and challenging for the players involved.                </p>
