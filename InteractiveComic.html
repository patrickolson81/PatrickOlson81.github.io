                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge entailed the creation of an interactive comic based on a randomly assigned topic. Our objective was to transform this topic into a cohesive and engaging project. The topic we were given was the bidirectional flow of time.

                <h2>Action</h2>
                <p>Working closely with my team, I played a vital role in ensuring the successful execution of this project. Collaborating with another developer, we collectively implemented coding solutions essential to realize our comic's vision. My primary responsibilities as one of the project's key coders included scripting and implementing the comic's navigation system, camera functionality, and various interactive elements. This collaborative effort aimed to bring our unique story and comic to life.                </p>
